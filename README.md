# Roman-material-database

ABSTRACT: The Historic Materials Database is an interactive database of construction materials used in antiquity. This is the first step of my larger PhD project that will enable a wider audience to create 3D and virtual reality (VR) models of historic structures.  By helping a user build accurate models, my project will provide new perspectives of historic buildings and cities to historians, archaeologists, and others who study the past.

PROJECT NARRATIVE



Current methods for viewing and analyzing historic structures are mainly 2D.   Scholars such as archaeologists, civil engineers, and historians each have their own focused skill set. They often do not have all the knowledge necessary to create a model which is both structurally and historically accurate. Our project works to address this knowledge gap. We are writing a program that enables a non-technical scholar to easily reconstruct buildings from the past. The structures created will be stable and contain only historically accurate materials. The Historic Materials Database--an interactive database of historic construction materials--is the first step in this project. 

 By July 2018, we will have created the materials database and developed a web-based front-end. This front-end will allow a user to interact with a map of non-provincial Rome. Through the map they can discover what types of stones and timber builders used from 30BC to 284CE.


FUNDING

This project is due to the support of many different organizations. Most importantly, the Center for Digital Humanties at Princeton helped this project both monetarily and throughout development stages--it would not be possible with out them. Also, thank you to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Princeton, Civil and Environmental Engineering, the Dean's Fund for Innovation at Princeton University, the Sollenberger Family Grant, and the National Science Foundation.
